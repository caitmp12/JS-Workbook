//For Loops

//1. Write a for loop that counts from 0 to 100 and console.log each number

for (i=0; i<=100; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}

//2. Write antoehr for loop that counts from 7 to 635 

for (i=7; i<= 635; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}

//3. Declare a variable 
let start = 0
//Declare a variable
const limit = 22
//Write a loop that counts from the value of start to the value of limit, using those variables in the control panel of the loop

for (start; start <= limit; start++) {
    console.log(start)
}
